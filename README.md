# Kuka-KR-16
This is a project based on PID control of an industrial manipulator: Kuka KR-16. The complete manipulator (6-D.O.F) assembly is modelled in Solidworks. The CAD model is used in Simechanics environment in MatLab/Simulink  with PID controllers for motion control.

# Kuka Solidwork Assembly
This folder contains .SLDPRT files for individual parts of the manipulator and the complete assembly (.SLDASM file).

# Kuka MatLab Files
This folder contains the simulink model (Kuka.slx) of the manipulator converted using simechanics. To control each joint's motion a PID controller is used.
